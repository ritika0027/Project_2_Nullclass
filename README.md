**Twitter Engagement Analysis - Power BI Dashboard**

**Overview**

This project involves building an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides insights into tweet engagement. The dashboard includes visualizations that highlight key metrics such as clicks, media interactions, and tweet engagement patterns based on specific conditions.

**Technologies Used**

1. Power BI
2. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculated measures and columns
3. Power Query (M Language) for data transformations

**Task Assigned**
1. Build a pie chart that represents the proportion of total clicks (URL clicks, user profile clicks, and hashtag clicks) for tweets with more than 500 impressions. Include a drill-down to view the specific types of clicks for each tweet

2. Create a clustered bar chart that breaks down the sum of URL clicks, user profile clicks, and hashtag clicks by tweet category (e.g., tweets with media, tweets with links, tweets with hashtags). Only include tweets that have at least one of these interaction types and this graph should work only between 3PM IST to 5 PM IST apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself and the tweet date should be even number as well as tweet word count be above 40.

3. Create a dual-axis chart that shows the number of media views and media engagements by the day of the week for the last quarter. Highlight days with significant spikes in media interactions. this graph should work only between 3PM IST to 5 PM IST and 7 AM to 11AM apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself and the tweet impression should be even number and tweet date should be odd number as well as tweet character count should be above 30 and need to remove tweet word which has letter 'H'.
